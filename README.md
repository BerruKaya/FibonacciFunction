# FibonacciFunction
Consists a function "fib(n)" that takes in a number as an argument. The function returns the n-th number of Fibonacci sequnce. The 1st and 2nd element in the Fibonacci sequence is 1. We find the next element as the sum of previous two elements.

n:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...
fib(n):1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34...
